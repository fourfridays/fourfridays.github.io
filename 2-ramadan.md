<blockquote>
  O you who believe, fasting is prescribed to you as it was prescribed to those before you, that you may (learn) self-restraint.
  <small>Qurâ€™an 2: 183</small>
</blockquote>

Remember that Lailatu Al-qadr is expected to occur during one of these days.This is just a reminder that we have started our night prayers program as follows for the last ten days of Ramadan:

* Iqamah for Isha prayer starts immediately after Azan time.
* Immediately after Isha we complete 8 rakas.
* We take a break of 20 to 30 minutes maximum to allow worshipers to rest. 
* Then we resume our prayers with 7 more rakas. 
* Fajr prayer Iqamah time is at 5:15AM

This program will allow members who are studying or working early morning to take some rest, have their suhur, and be an active member in society.  May Allah accept from all of us. Ameen
