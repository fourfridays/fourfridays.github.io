## Eid Announcement

Sunday July 11, 2021 was the first day of Dhul-Hijja and the day of Hajj (Yaum-e-Arafah) is on Monday, July 19, 2021. Thus, the day of Eid (Eid-ul-Adha) is on Tuesday July 20, 2021.

EID MUBARAK to all of you. Our sincere prayers are for the people who are suffering around the world, and for peace and justice in every land.

The Eid prayer has been decided to be at 8:30AM. As a tradition, there will be a potluck breakfast right after the Eid prayer. Please bring sweets, snacks, and/or drink.
