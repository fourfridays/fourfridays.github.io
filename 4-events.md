## Eid Announcement

Thursday May 13, 2021 is the first day of Shawwal and, thus, the day of Eid-ul-Fitr. Brothers in the ICEK masjid have agreed to have Eid prayer at 9:00AM sharp. After prayer, there will be a potluck breakfast, insha'Allah.

MAKE SURE TO PAY YOUR ZAKAT AL-FITR BEFORE EID PRAYER!!!
