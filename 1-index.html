<p><strong>As-Salaam-Alaikum (peace be unto you) Brothers and Sisters,</strong></p>

<p>The Islamic Center of Emporia (masjid) is the place of worship for all followers of Islam (muslims) to perform their daily congregational prayers. It is also where members of the Emporia community gather to celebrate, exchange wisdom, and dialogue with members of the masjid.</p>

<p>The masjid kicked-off a fundraising project on March 07, 2015 with a goal to raise $100,000 by end of Summer 2015. You can learn more about the project and give for the sake of Allah by clicking <a href="/fundraising/">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Jazak Allahu Khayran (may Allah reward you with goodness),</strong></p>
