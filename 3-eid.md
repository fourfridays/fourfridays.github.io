<p>Eid Prayer will be held at 8:00AM on Friday, July 17th at the Islamic Center.  Prayer starts at 8:00AM followed by a short Khutbah. Immediately after completion of Eid Prayer, we will socialize and have our traditional community breakfast together. This is a potluck style breakfast. Which means, bring a cooked dish or whatever you wish.</p>

<p>Also remember that there will be no Jumu'ah prayer this week, since Eid was on a Friday.</p>
